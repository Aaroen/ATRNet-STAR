<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Analyzing Test Scripts**

I've been examining the `SOC50_HiVit_Ar.py` script and noticed the `--test_only` and `--test_checkpoint` flags. My plan is to leverage these flags to efficiently test the models found in the `results` directory. I'm focusing on how best to integrate this with the existing pipeline.


**Refining Testing Strategy**

I've determined that the `SOC50_HiVit_Ar.py` script utilizes the `--test_only` and `--test_checkpoint` flags for targeted model evaluation. My focus has shifted towards crafting a script that iterates through the provided model files in the `results` directory. The goal is to generate and execute a specific command for each model, effectively streamlining the testing process. I'm carefully analyzing how the script handles checkpoint paths to ensure seamless integration.


**Orchestrating Test Runs**

Now I'm devising the loop structure to iterate through the model files in `results`. I'll build the command using the script's `--test_only` flag and provide the appropriate `--test_checkpoint` path for each model.  The script seems to be set up to handle this with the logic checking for the path and the correct file extension. I'll need to check the path handling and how it interacts with the `rank` to make sure testing runs as expected.


**Constructing the Execution Loop**

I am now focusing on the creation of the execution loop.  Given the file names and the script's use of the `--test_checkpoint` flag, I will generate a command for each model in the `results` directory.  The objective is to feed the correct path into the `--test_checkpoint` argument of the `SOC50_HiVit_Ar.py` script.  I'm making sure that I handle the `rank` check in the script correctly as the script may require some additional work to execute the desired models.


**Isolating HiViT Models**

I've determined that the `SOC50_HiVit_Ar.py` script is specifically designed for `HiViT_base` models. Consequently, I will need to filter the model list in the `results` directory to include only the  `HiViT` models: `SOC_50classes_HiViT_nopre_52933.pth`,  `SOC_50classes_HiViT_SGDR_94770.pth`, and `SOC_50classes_HiViT_SGDR_89571.pth`. This is to avoid errors when loading and testing these model files using the script. The script expects the model file to be a `.pth` or `.pt` file, which these model files are. I'll construct a new loop that will iterate through this reduced model file list, generating the execution command and executing the script.


**Finalizing the Test Script**

I've determined that `SOC50_HiVit_Ar.py` targets HiViT models specifically. Consequently, I'll filter the `results` directory to include only these: `SOC_50classes_HiViT_nopre_52933.pth`, `SOC_50classes_HiViT_SGDR_94770.pth`, and `SOC_50classes_HiViT_SGDR_89571.pth`. This ensures compatibility and avoids potential errors. The command generation and execution loop are now finalized, with the correct paths and flags for testing.


**Implementing the Test Loop**

I'm now iterating through the filtered HiViT model list, generating the necessary command for each. The path to each checkpoint is being correctly incorporated into the `--test_checkpoint` argument. I'm focusing on crafting the execution loop to ensure efficient and accurate testing.


**Formulating Test Commands**

Now I'm crafting a script that iterates through the `results` directory and isolates the HiViT models: `SOC_50classes_HiViT_nopre_52933.pth`, `SOC_50classes_HiViT_SGDR_94770.pth`, and `SOC_50classes_HiViT_SGDR_89571.pth`. My plan is to execute `SOC50_HiVit_Ar.py` with the `--test_only` and `--test_checkpoint` flags for each of these. I will use the path for each as the value for the `--test_checkpoint` flag.


**Isolating Relevant Models**

I'm now focusing on the targeted execution of `SOC50_HiVit_Ar.py` with the `--test_checkpoint` flag. My current strategy involves filtering the model files within the `results` directory to include only the HiViT models. This is crucial for ensuring compatibility, as the script is specifically designed for HiViT architecture. I will construct the execution loop, building the necessary commands with the correct paths.


**Orchestrating Test Runs**

I'm focused on executing `SOC50_HiVit_Ar.py` with the `--test_checkpoint` flag, targeting HiViT models only due to script compatibility. I'll filter the model list to include: `SOC_50classes_HiViT_nopre_52933.pth`, `SOC_50classes_HiViT_SGDR_94770.pth`, and `SOC_50classes_HiViT_SGDR_89571.pth`. This ensures the testing phase runs successfully.

好的，我已经仔细查看了 `SOC50_HiVit_Ar.py` 脚本。

该脚本是为 `HiViT` 模型架构设计的，因此我将使用它来测试您提供的 `results` 目录中所有与 `HiViT` 相关的模型。对于其他模型（如 `ConvNeXt` 和 `SARatrX`），需要使用它们各自对应的测试脚本。

我将依次对以下三个 `HiViT` 模型进行测试：

1.  `results/SOC_50classes_HiViT_nopre_52933.pth`
2.  `results/SOC_50classes_HiViT_SGDR_89571.pth`
3.  `results/SOC_50classes_HiViT_SGDR_94770.pth`

首先，我将测试第一个模型。

```bash
python3 ATRBench/Classification/HiViT/SOC50_HiVit_Ar.py --test_only --test_checkpoint results/SOC_50classes_HiViT_nopre_52933.pth
```
